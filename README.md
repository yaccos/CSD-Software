# CSD-Software
Software for generating differential gene co-expression networks using the CSD-framework


This software was developed as a part of my M.Sc thesis at NTNU. For a description of the program, and how to use it, see chapter 3 in the file "Master_Thesis.pdf".

This fork includes support for macOS, but requires the community LLVM compiler to be installed in `/usr/local/opt/llvm`. This can be obtained by following the instructions on https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/2/20/installing-clangllvm-on-osx.
